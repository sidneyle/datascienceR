Description: A translation of the `datascience` package in Python to R. The 
  Python package was initially created for Data 8 at UC Berkeley, an 
  introductory data science course. While the class was taught mostly in Python, 
  much of the Statistics and Economics departments still use R. This package 
  attempts to make the material and techniques in Data 8 accessible to R users.
